# Ten-Chord-Workout

**The project is still a WIP**

## What is Ten-Chord-Workout ?  

This is a small game written in Javascript where one has to correctly
identify the notes in music chords that are flashed on the screen.

## Why the name Ten-Chord-Workout ?

The rules and the scoring system of this game fairly resemble that of
[Ten-Pin-Bowling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling) and
you can score "strikes" and "spares" just as in the original game.  At
the same time it helps in practicing music theory too.

It started as an `example app` for my guitar chord library but I later
spiced it up for fun and learning!

## Dependencies
1. [JQuery](http://jquery.com) 
   
   The indispensable!
   
2. [GuitarJs](https://github.com/naiquevin/GuitarJs)
   
   This is a small library I wrote a while back.
   
3. [Spine.js](http://spinejs.com/) 
   
   Please note that the version of spine.js currently used is pretty
   old as I had started with this app more a year ago when Spine was
   very new. I don't know if I will update it to work with the latest
   Spine code which has gone through a lot of changes. My MVC
   framework of choice these days is Backbone and a rewrite is highly
   unlikely.
