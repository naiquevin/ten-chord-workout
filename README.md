# Ten-Chord-Workout

**The project is still a WIP**

## What is Ten-Chord-Workout ?
This is a small game written in Javascript where one has to 
correctly "guess" or identify the notes in music chords that are 
flashed on the screen.

## Why the name Ten-Chord-Workout ?
The rules and the scoring system of this game fairly resemble that 
of [Ten-Pin-Bowling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling)
and you can score "strikes" and "spares" just as in the original game.
At the same time it helps in practicing music theory as well.

## Dependencies
1. [GuitarJs](https://github.com/naiquevin/GuitarJs)
   This is a small library I had written as a fun exercise a while back.
   
2. [Spine.js](http://spinejs.com/)
   Please note that the version of spine.js currently used in this project 
   is pretty old as I had started with this app when spine was just out.
   I am aware that spine has undegone a lot of improvements and I do plan
   to make this project new spine compatible when I get time.
